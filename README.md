# SVG Community Group Projects

The [SVG Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/svgcg/) is a place to discuss new features for SVG,
or new tools for making SVG work easier.

This repository is a discussion forum, where group members can suggest new projects using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/svg-cg/projects/issues).

Once projects are well underway, this will also be where project leads can ask the rest of the group to publish a draft or final report.
